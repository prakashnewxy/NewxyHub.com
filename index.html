    <h1>BLOX FURIT</h1>
    <p>Blox Fruits is a popular game on Roblox that offers players a chance to participate in a maritime adventure reminiscent of the popular anime One Piece1. In the game, you can choose between the pirates and marines when you first launch into Blox Fruits1. You can find and eat Devil Fruits that grant users unique powers1.

    As for the fruits, they are magic-based weapons in Blox Fruits that deal massive damage against enemies and bosses2. There are 23 total devil fruits in the experience, with each one dealing different elemental power and possessing unique movesets tied to that element, sometimes two movesets depending on the fruit2.

    You can get Devil Fruit in Blox Fruits from the Blox Fruit Dealer who sells all devil fruits for Beli (in-game currency) or Robux2. The devil fruits rotate stock in the Blox Fruit Dealerâ€™s inventory every four hours2</p>
