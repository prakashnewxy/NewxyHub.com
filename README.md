## Anonymous

Anonymous-Static is an easy to setup unblocker for you to deploy.

## About Anonymous

Anonymous was created by [Gage](https://github.com/oHeckGage), [Vortex](https://github.com/Vortexzzzz), and [Rena](https://github.com/renagamer101). It is supposed to be a super easy deployable proxy service for mass link creation and simplicity.

## Upcoming

I am planning on adding a lot of new things (check the releases tab for a full list) including an React/Next.js version of Anonymous, more games, more movies, more proxies and more.
